# The React Web Chat Application

A react web application that enables users to chat to each other over the internet. It uses the Chatengine API to design the chat feed with other features.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## My process

The first thing that came to my mind when building this project was to build it from scracth, that idea ended up being very overwhelming. Luckily, through my research, i found an API called Chat engine, which makes creating chat applications very easy. With my knowledge of javascript and react, i was able to build a functional chat application tha made use of react components and hooks.

### Built with

- React Components.
- React hooks.
- [Chat engine API](https://chatengine.io)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Axios.
- Mobile-first workflow.

### What I learned

THis project was conducted just a week after I had finished my anime database application, so the knowledge of using react and how to interact with an API was still fresh in my memory. I decided to take a different approach in communicating with the Chat engine API by using Axios insted of the built in fetch method. This project also needed me to  use my undrstanding of conditional statements and array manipulation in displaying both messages of the users.

I also learned that when it has to do with learning projects like this, my aim is to find different ways to address the problem right in front of me, whether it has to be done from scracth or to use a tested and proven library that makes me more productive.




### Continued development

I aim to learn how to add more features into this project, like auto deletion and being able to change the background image to a users particullar choice.
